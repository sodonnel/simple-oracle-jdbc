Allow more types to override the Ruby type, eg Time as Timestamp, if that is sensible??
  -- Date as a Timestamp
  -- String as a CLOB
  -- String as a CHAR

Bindable types that are not yet supported:
  -- passing a ref_cursor into a proc
  -- binding a CLOB to a procedure

Types that cannot be retrieved from an SQL result set
  -- CLOB
  -- Cursor
  -- Long
  -- nvarchar etc

Consider making ref_cursors be returned in a different object to the SQL object.
